* [Windows Only: Install RTools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)
    * When installed, run in the RStudio Console: `write('PATH="${RTOOLS40_HOME}\\usr\\bin;${PATH}"', file = "~/.Renviron", append = TRUE)`
* [Windows Only: Install WSL2](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/how-to-install-wsl2-on-windows-10)
