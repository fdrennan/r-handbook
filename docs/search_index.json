You can think of them as having \\(1*n\\) cells where \\(n\\) is any positive integer, and make up the rows and columns of tables. Vectors have a few components that make them special. First, they always contain the same type of value. R has many different data types, but the most common are numeric, character, and logical (TRUE/FALSE). Rule 1: Vectors only contain one type of data. Rule 2: Vectors are always \\(1xn\\) dimensional, \\(1xn=n\\) where \\(n\\) is the length of the vector. Rule 3: Vectors dont always have names, but should if it makes sense. 4.2 Functions Functions are containers where anything or nothing can happen, but whatever happens, it happens the same way every single time. They allow for generalization of complicated ideas and routines that we wish to repeat over and over again. A function may have an input, but no output. It may have an output, but no input, both or none. If its something you need to do repeatedly, or containing code makes your program easier to read, then write a function for that process. Rule 4: Functions have inputs, outputs, and a body. A function can have multiple outputs, but given a particular set of inputs, the solution should never change assuming you are not developing a function with randomness built in. R has a built-in constant called letters. This means that no matter where you are writing R, letters will be available to you. We see that letters is a character vector in our program below, and use the composition of functions to create a program that describes letters. print(letters) ## [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot; &quot;d&quot; &quot;e&quot; &quot;f&quot; &quot;g&quot; &quot;h&quot; &quot;i&quot; &quot;j&quot; &quot;k&quot; &quot;l&quot; &quot;m&quot; &quot;n&quot; &quot;o&quot; &quot;p&quot; &quot;q&quot; &quot;r&quot; &quot;s&quot; ## [20] &quot;t&quot; &quot;u&quot; &quot;v&quot; &quot;w&quot; &quot;x&quot; &quot;y&quot; &quot;z&quot; Next, we can use some functions which take in pretty much any object that exists in R and spits back information regarding the letters data. main &lt;- function() { print_information &lt;- function(x) { variable_name = deparse1(substitute(x)) length_x = length(x) typeof_x &lt;- typeof(x) is_vec_x &lt;- is.vector(x) meta_list &lt;- list( length = length_x, type = typeof_x, is_vector = is_vec_x ) cli::cli_alert(&#39;Information about {variable_name}&#39;) cli::cli_alert_info(&quot;{variable_name} is a 1x{length_x} dimensional&quot;) cli::cli_alert_info(&quot;&quot;) purrr::iwalk(meta_list, function(x, index) { cli::cli_alert_info(glue::glue(&#39;{index} {x} is type {typeof(x)}&#39;)) }) return(meta_list) } cli::cli_alert_info(&#39;Execute print_information&#39;) output &lt;- print_information(mtcars) cli::cli_alert_success(&#39;Execute print_information complete&#39;) print(output) } main() ## i Execute print_information ## &gt; Information about mtcars ## i mtcars is a 1x11 dimensional ## i ## i length 11 is type integer ## i type list is type character ## i is_vector FALSE is type logical ## v Execute print_information complete ## $length ## [1] 11 ## ## $type ## [1] &quot;list&quot; ## ## $is_vector ## [1] FALSE "],["debugging.html", "Chapter 5 Debugging 5.1 What is the debugger? 5.2 How to learn R without knowing any R 5.3 browser() 5.4 debug and undebug 5.5 debugonce 5.6 Understanding debugging output", " Chapter 5 Debugging 5.1 What is the debugger? 5.2 How to learn R without knowing any R 5.3 browser() 5.4 debug and undebug 5.5 debugonce 5.6 Understanding debugging output "],["vectors-1.html", "Chapter 6 Vectors 6.1 c 6.2 [ and [[", " Chapter 6 Vectors 6.1 c 6.2 [ and [[ Vectors atomic Strings Base R stringr Regular Expressions Cheat Sheet Numbers Integer Double Factors as.factor vs. as_factor Dates Base R lubridate "],["lists.html", "Chapter 7 Lists 7.1 list 7.2 [ and [[", " Chapter 7 Lists 7.1 list 7.2 [ and [[ Lists list() and c [ and [[ Connection between lists and json jsonlite "],["vectors-2.html", "Chapter 8 Vectors 8.1 c 8.2 [ and [[", " Chapter 8 Vectors 8.1 c 8.2 [ and [[ Tables matrices data.frame vs tibble data.frames are lists with equal length, atomic vectors "],["functional-programming.html", "Chapter 9 Functional Programming 9.1 Base R 9.2 Modern R", " Chapter 9 Functional Programming Functions Sequences Mapping functions pipes void return Can a function return nothing?
