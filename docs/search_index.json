Update to renv later. 1.2 A Dose of Theory I struggle to determine the best way to start a book like this. But, as someone who has read one or two programming books, I cant help but get tired of the Hello World introduction. If you dont know what I am talking about, dont worry, you will but I wont bother you with that here. Instead, I want to talk about boring lists. A list is a container for anything that exists in the R world. Lists can be named or unnamed. list_with_values &lt;- list( first_value_name = 1, hello = mtcars, model = lm(cyl ~ mpg, mtcars) ) How do I know if a function is vectorized install.packages(&#39;tidyverse&#39;) "],["literature.html", "Chapter 2 Literature", " Chapter 2 Literature Here is a review of existing methods.

You can think of them as having \\(1*n\\) cells where \\(n\\) is any positive integer, and make up the rows and columns of tables. Vectors always contain the same type of value. R has many different types of vectors, but the most common are numeric, character, and logical (TRUE/FALSE). Vectors are cool. I like to think of them as boxes that can only be stacked on top of one another. typeof(c(TRUE)) ## [1] &quot;logical&quot; typeof(c(TRUE, 1)) ## [1] &quot;double&quot; typeof(c(TRUE, 1, &#39;a&#39;)) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; 4.2 Functions Functions are containers where anything or nothing can happen, but whatever happens, it happens the same way every single time. They allow for generalization of complicated ideas and routines that we wish to repeat over and over again. A function may have an input, but no output. It may have an output, but no input, both or none. If its something you need to do repeatedly, or containing code makes your program easier to read, then write a function for that process. Rule 4: Functions have inputs, outputs, and a body. A function can have multiple outputs, but given a particular set of inputs, the solution should never change assuming you are not developing a function with randomness built in. R has a built-in constant called letters. This means that no matter where you are writing R, letters will be available to you. We see that letters is a character vector in our program below, and use the composition of functions to create a program that describes letters. print(letters) ## [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot; &quot;d&quot; &quot;e&quot; &quot;f&quot; &quot;g&quot; &quot;h&quot; &quot;i&quot; &quot;j&quot; &quot;k&quot; &quot;l&quot; &quot;m&quot; &quot;n&quot; &quot;o&quot; &quot;p&quot; &quot;q&quot; &quot;r&quot; &quot;s&quot; ## [20] &quot;t&quot; &quot;u&quot; &quot;v&quot; &quot;w&quot; &quot;x&quot; &quot;y&quot; &quot;z&quot; Next, we can use some functions which take in pretty much any object that exists in R and spits back information regarding the letters data. main &lt;- function() { print_information &lt;- function(x) { variable_name = deparse1(substitute(x)) length_x = length(x) typeof_x &lt;- typeof(x) is_vec_x &lt;- is.vector(x) meta_list &lt;- list( length = length_x, type = typeof_x, is_vector = is_vec_x ) cli::cli_alert(&#39;Information about {variable_name}&#39;) cli::cli_alert_info(&quot;{variable_name} is a 1x{length_x} dimensional&quot;) cli::cli_alert_info(&quot;&quot;) purrr::iwalk(meta_list, function(x, index) { cli::cli_alert_info(glue::glue(&#39;{index} {x} is type {typeof(x)}&#39;)) }) return(meta_list) } cli::cli_alert_info(&#39;Execute print_information&#39;) output &lt;- print_information(mtcars) cli::cli_alert_success(&#39;Execute print_information complete&#39;) print(output) } main() ## i Execute print_information ## &gt; Information about mtcars ## i mtcars is a 1x11 dimensional ## i ## i length 11 is type integer ## i type list is type character ## i is_vector FALSE is type logical ## v Execute print_information complete ## $length ## [1] 11 ## ## $type ## [1] &quot;list&quot; ## ## $is_vector ## [1] FALSE "],["debugging.html", "Chapter 5 Debugging 5.1 What is the debugger? 5.2 How to learn R without knowing any R 5.3 browser() 5.4 next, continue 5.5 debug and undebug 5.6 debugonce 5.7 Understanding debugging output 5.8 LOTS OF DEBUGGING EXERCISES CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH", " Chapter 5 Debugging 5.1 What is the debugger? 5.2 How to learn R without knowing any R 5.3 browser() 5.4 next, continue 5.5 debug and undebug 5.6 debugonce 5.7 Understanding debugging output 5.8 LOTS OF DEBUGGING EXERCISES CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH "],["vectors-1.html", "Chapter 6 Vectors 6.1 c 6.2 [ and [[", " Chapter 6 Vectors 6.1 c 6.2 [ and [[ Vectors atomic Strings Base R stringr Regular Expressions Cheat Sheet Numbers Integer Double Factors as.factor vs.Â as_factor Dates Base R lubridate "],["lists.html", "Chapter 7 Lists 7.1 list 7.2 [ and [[", " Chapter 7 Lists 7.1 list 7.2 [ and [[ Lists list() and c [ and [[ Connection between lists and json jsonlite "],["tables.html", "Chapter 8 Tables 8.1 c 8.2 [ and [[", " Chapter 8 Tables 8.1 c 8.2 [ and [[ Tables matrices data.frame vs tibble data.frames are lists with equal length, atomic vectors "],["functional-programming.html", "Chapter 9 Functional Programming 9.1 Base R 9.2 Modern R", " Chapter 9 Functional Programming Functions Sequences Mapping functions pipes void return Can a function return nothing?
