Suppose we have a friend that is interested in the current trend regarding COVID-19 cases. The first thing we will probably do is try to figure out an efficient and reliable way for importing Covid-19 data into our R session. Conveniently, the COVID19 package allows us to pull the latest data without any hard work and consists of one function - covid19. A function does stuff given a set of inputs. Remember seeing equations like \\(y = 2x + 3\\) in algebra? We said given \\(x=2\\) then \\(y=7\\). because \\(2(2) + 3 = 7\\). In calculus, equations became functions with a slightly different syntax. \\(f(x) = 2x + 3\\). What happened to the \\(y\\)? Well, nothing really. We can say \\(y=f(x)=x^2\\) or \\(result=f(x)\\) or \\(z=g(x,y)=x + min(x, y)\\). Once we have these definitions, we can go further and compose them together. For example, \\(f(g(x, y)) = (x + min(x, y))^2\\). Now, the outputs of functions become the inputs for other functions. library(cli) # Same as f(x) = 2x + 3 f &lt;- function(x) { x &lt;- x * x x } g &lt;- function(x=NULL, y=NULL) { result &lt;- x + min(x, y) result } print(f(g(3, 4))) ## [1] 36 We now have a way of describing inputs and output a little more clearly. Instead of writing, \\((3 + min(3, 4)) * (3 + min(3, 4))\\) we can write \\(f(g(3, 4))\\) or try new creations like \\(z(x, y)=f(g(f(x), f(y)))\\) so \\(z(1, 2)=f(g(f(1), f(2)))=f(g(1, 4))=f(2)=4\\). Now just take this idea about functions and expand your definition of inputs and outputs to be any number, none or many, and of any type that R supports - character, numeric, date/time, data.frame or list - all of which well cover. In your RStudio console, you can write the following to install the COVID19 package using the install.packages function. If you are interested in learning more about this function, you can write ?install.packages in your console and the documentation for the function will appear. # For help menu, uncomment next line # ?install.packages # If the package is not yet installed, you can install it by passing # a string with the package name to the `install.packages` function install.packages(pkgs = c(&#39;COVID19&#39;)) For a full list of what packages are available through the install.packages function, please check out the Contributed Packages page at CRAN or scrape it yourself. library(rvest) cran_packages &lt;- &#39;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_date.html&#39; html_table(html_element(read_html(cran_packages), &#39;table&#39;)) ## # A tibble: 18,468 x 3 ## Date Package Title ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 2021-11-23 dataCompareR Compare Two Data Frames and Summarise the Difference ## 2 2021-11-23 DescTools Tools for Descriptive Statistics ## 3 2021-11-23 makepipe Pipeline Tools Inspired by &#39;GNU Make&#39; ## 4 2021-11-22 abtest Bayesian A/B Testing ## 5 2021-11-22 Bestie Bayesian Estimation of Intervention Effects ## 6 2021-11-22 brms Bayesian Regression Models using &#39;Stan&#39; ## 7 2021-11-22 cgrcusum Continuous Time Generalized Rapid Response CUSUM ## 8 2021-11-22 clustra Clustering Trajectories Anchored at Intervention Time ## 9 2021-11-22 cpsR Load CPS Microdata into R Using the &#39;Census Bureau D~ ## 10 2021-11-22 crul HTTP Client ## # ... with 18,458 more rows WRITE ABOUT HELP MENU? Im a man of few words. So lets get to it. The two lines of code below consist of three functions. The first two are library and covid19, but the third is hidden, and I will disclose where shortly. Functions are spaces for stuff to happen. Functions help us make common procedures repeatable. By creating a function with a particular name and inputs, we can get some sort of useful (or not useful, the worlds your oyster) output. In this case, library loads packages from a folder in the R environment called library. You can see which ones your R environment knows about by running the function .libPaths(). covid19 is a function from the COVID19 package, and would only be available after executing library(COVID19) or if library(COVID19) is omitted, by pulling it from the package namespace directly by preceding the function with the package name and two colons like so: COVID19::covid19. Generally speaking, you simply use library because it reduces the amount of text on the page. library(COVID19) ## Warning: package &#39;COVID19&#39; was built under R version 4.1.2 covid_data &lt;- covid19( country = &#39;United States&#39;, start = &#39;2021-01-01&#39;, end = &quot;2021-11-21&quot;, verbose = FALSE ) How do I know if a function is vectorized 1.2 Initial Setup Book Outline Install R Install R Studio Windows Only: Install RTools When installed, run in the RStudio Console: write('PATH=\"${RTOOLS40_HOME}\\\\usr\\\\bin;${PATH}\"', file = \"~/.Renviron\", append = TRUE) Windows Only: Install WSL2 Computer should be completely updated before install.

You can think of them as having \\(1*n\\) cells where \\(n\\) is any positive integer, and make up the rows and columns of tables. Vectors always contain the same type of value. R has many different types of vectors, but the most common are numeric, character, and logical (TRUE/FALSE). Vectors are cool. I like to think of them as boxes that can only be stacked on top of one another. typeof(c(TRUE)) ## [1] &quot;logical&quot; typeof(c(TRUE, 1)) ## [1] &quot;double&quot; typeof(c(TRUE, 1, &#39;a&#39;)) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; 3.2 Functions Functions are containers where anything or nothing can happen, but whatever happens, it happens the same way every single time. They allow for generalization of complicated ideas and routines that we wish to repeat over and over again. A function may have an input, but no output. It may have an output, but no input, both or none. If its something you need to do repeatedly, or containing code makes your program easier to read, then write a function for that process. Rule 4: Functions have inputs, outputs, and a body. A function can have multiple outputs, but given a particular set of inputs, the solution should never change assuming you are not developing a function with randomness built in. R has a built-in constant called letters. This means that no matter where you are writing R, letters will be available to you. We see that letters is a character vector in our program below, and use the composition of functions to create a program that describes letters. print(letters) ## [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot; &quot;d&quot; &quot;e&quot; &quot;f&quot; &quot;g&quot; &quot;h&quot; &quot;i&quot; &quot;j&quot; &quot;k&quot; &quot;l&quot; &quot;m&quot; &quot;n&quot; &quot;o&quot; &quot;p&quot; &quot;q&quot; &quot;r&quot; &quot;s&quot; ## [20] &quot;t&quot; &quot;u&quot; &quot;v&quot; &quot;w&quot; &quot;x&quot; &quot;y&quot; &quot;z&quot; Next, we can use some functions which take in pretty much any object that exists in R and spits back information regarding the letters data. main &lt;- function() { print_information &lt;- function(x) { variable_name = deparse1(substitute(x)) length_x = length(x) typeof_x &lt;- typeof(x) is_vec_x &lt;- is.vector(x) meta_list &lt;- list( length = length_x, type = typeof_x, is_vector = is_vec_x ) cli::cli_alert(&#39;Information about {variable_name}&#39;) cli::cli_alert_info(&quot;{variable_name} is a 1x{length_x} dimensional&quot;) cli::cli_alert_info(&quot;&quot;) purrr::iwalk(meta_list, function(x, index) { cli::cli_alert_info(glue::glue(&#39;{index} {x} is type {typeof(x)}&#39;)) }) return(meta_list) } cli::cli_alert_info(&#39;Execute print_information&#39;) output &lt;- print_information(mtcars) cli::cli_alert_success(&#39;Execute print_information complete&#39;) print(output) } main() ## i Execute print_information ## &gt; Information about mtcars ## i mtcars is a 1x11 dimensional ## i ## i length 11 is type integer ## i type list is type character ## i is_vector FALSE is type logical ## v Execute print_information complete ## $length ## [1] 11 ## ## $type ## [1] &quot;list&quot; ## ## $is_vector ## [1] FALSE "],["debugging.html", "Chapter 4 Debugging 4.1 What is the debugger? 4.2 How to learn R without knowing any R 4.3 browser() 4.4 next, continue 4.5 debug and undebug 4.6 debugonce 4.7 Understanding debugging output 4.8 LOTS OF DEBUGGING EXERCISES CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH", " Chapter 4 Debugging 4.1 What is the debugger? 4.2 How to learn R without knowing any R 4.3 browser() 4.4 next, continue 4.5 debug and undebug 4.6 debugonce 4.7 Understanding debugging output 4.8 LOTS OF DEBUGGING EXERCISES CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH "],["vectors-1.html", "Chapter 5 Vectors 5.1 c 5.2 [ and [[", " Chapter 5 Vectors 5.1 c 5.2 [ and [[ Vectors atomic Strings Base R stringr Regular Expressions Cheat Sheet Numbers Integer Double Factors as.factor vs.Â as_factor Dates Base R lubridate "],["lists.html", "Chapter 6 Lists 6.1 list 6.2 [ and [[", " Chapter 6 Lists 6.1 list 6.2 [ and [[ Lists list() and c [ and [[ Connection between lists and json jsonlite "],["tables.html", "Chapter 7 Tables 7.1 c 7.2 [ and [[", " Chapter 7 Tables 7.1 c 7.2 [ and [[ Tables matrices data.frame vs tibble data.frames are lists with equal length, atomic vectors "],["functional-programming.html", "Chapter 8 Functional Programming 8.1 Base R 8.2 Modern R", " Chapter 8 Functional Programming Functions Sequences Mapping functions pipes void return Can a function return nothing?
