But, as someone who has read one or two programming books, I cant help but get tired of Hello World. If you dont know what I am talking about, dont worry, you will but I wont bother you with that here. Instead, I want to talk about vectorization and mapping. You will spend the majority of your time choosing functions to transform vectors of one form to another. If you want to learn the math behind vectors, watch the first few videos of a linear algebra course. Here, Im going to tell you how to think about them for the purpose of using R. Vectors are a special kind of list. A list is simply a container that holds information and has either a named or numeric value. list_with_values &lt;- list(first_value_name = 1, hello = mtcars) dplyr::glimpse(list_with_values) ## List of 2 ## $ first_value_name: num 1 ## $ hello :&#39;data.frame&#39;: 32 obs. of 11 variables: ## ..$ mpg : num [1:32] 21 21 22.8 21.4 18.7 18.1 14.3 24.4 22.8 19.2 ... ## ..$ cyl : num [1:32] 6 6 4 6 8 6 8 4 4 6 ... ## ..$ disp: num [1:32] 160 160 108 258 360 ... ## ..$ hp : num [1:32] 110 110 93 110 175 105 245 62 95 123 ... ## ..$ drat: num [1:32] 3.9 3.9 3.85 3.08 3.15 2.76 3.21 3.69 3.92 3.92 ... ## ..$ wt : num [1:32] 2.62 2.88 2.32 3.21 3.44 ... ## ..$ qsec: num [1:32] 16.5 17 18.6 19.4 17 ... ## ..$ vs : num [1:32] 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 ... ## ..$ am : num [1:32] 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ... ## ..$ gear: num [1:32] 4 4 4 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 ... ## ..$ carb: num [1:32] 4 4 1 1 2 1 4 2 2 4 ...
